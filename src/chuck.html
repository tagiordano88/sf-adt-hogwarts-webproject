        <p>Below are some pictures from Disney Land. I went for the first time in 2019. I didn't know
            what to
            expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. We went for three days and had a park hopper pass. The first day
            we went and experienced many of the rides. Some of the rides that I really enjoyed were Radiator Springs
            Racers, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Splash Mountain. Soaring around the world was pretty amazing to. I was
            impressed with the cleanliness of the park and the food was pretty good to. I had several corn dogs that
            were recommended by friend that had gone in the past and I wasn't disappointed. The rides were put
            together so well and I was hooked after my first time going. I'm usually skeptical when it comes to
            spending money at theme parks, but Disney Land was worth every penny. </p>
